Fixes due to Trello UI changes.

### Version 1.9.19

Partial refactoring: export flow has been rewritten to better handle data to enable different export modes. **It is now possible to export to Excel and Markdown**, and more export formats could now more easily be added.

- refactoring export flow
- updated jQuery Growl to version 1.3.1
- new Markdown export mode

More info in this [blog post](http://trapias.github.io/blog/trelloexport-1-9-19). 

### Version 1.9.18

Improving UI:

- fix filename (YYYYMMDDhhmmss)
- fix some UI issues

### Version 1.9.17

Finally fixed (really) exporting ALL comments per card. We're now loading comments per single card from Trello API, which is **much slower** but assures all comments are exported.

### Version 1.9.15

Finally fixing comments export: should have finally fixed exporting of comments and 'done time' calculations: thanks @fepsch for sharing a board and allowing to identify this annoying bug.

### Version 1.9.14

Some bugfix and some new features.

**Fixes**:

- fixed card completion calculation when exporting multiple boards (fix getMoveCardAction and getCreateCardAction)
- loading comments with a new function (getCommentCardActions), trying to fix issues with comments reported by some users; please give feedback

**New features**:

- formatting dates in user (browser) locale
- added support for multiple 'Done' list names
- added capability to optionally filter exported lists by name when exporting multiple boards

Both the 'Done list name' and 'Filter lists by name' input boxes accept a comma-separated list of partial list names, i.e. just specify multiple names in the textbox like 'Done,Completed' (without apices). Lists will then be (case insensitively) matched when their name starts with one of these values.

More info in this [blog post](http://trapias.github.io/blog/trelloexport-1-9-14/). 

### Version 1.9.13

Some (interesting, hopefully!) improvements with this version:

- new 'DoneTime' column holding card completion time in days, hours, minutes and seconds, formatted as per [ISO8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)
- name (prefix) of 'Done' lists is now configurable, default "Done"
- larger options dialog to better show options
- export multiple (selected) boards
- export multiple (selected) cards in a list (i.e. export single cards)

More info in this [blog post](http://trapias.github.io/blog/trelloexport-1-9-13/). Give feeback!

### Version 1.8.9

- added linq.min.js library to support linq queries for the above modifications

#### Notes

I modified the **escapeXML** function in **xlsx.js** to avoid errors with XML characters when loading the spreadsheet in Excel. I tested exporting quite big boards like Trello Development or Trello Resources and no more have issues with invalid characters.
I put a couple of sample export files in the xlsx subfolder.

**Columns**: the list of columns exported is now:

	columnHeadings = ['List', 'Card #', 'Title', 'Link', 'Description', 'Checklists', 'Comments', 'Attachments', 'Votes', 'Spent', 'Estimate', 'Created', 'CreatedBy', 'Due', 'Done', 'DoneBy', 'Members', 'Labels']

##### datetimeDone and memberDone

These fields are calculated intercepting when a card was moved to the Done list. While bmccormack's code only checks for this list, I check for cards being moved to any list whose name starts with "Done" (e.g. using lists named "Done Bugfix", "Done New Feature" and so will work).

#### Formatting

I tried formatting data in a readable format, suggest changes if you don't like how it is now.

**Comments** are formatted with [date - username] comment, e.g.:

	[2014-01-31 18:38:31 - kathyschultz1] the add-on for exporting to Excel is a good start, but I'm w/all who dream of a report that includes checklists and comments. Thanks Trello warriors!

I added **commentLimit** to limit the number of comments to extract: play with the value (default 100) as per your needs.
There are currently no limits in the number of checklists, checklist items or attachments.

**Attachments** are listed in a similar way, with [filename] (bytes) url, e.g.:

	[chrome.jpg] (62806) https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/4d5ea62fd76aa1136000000c/520a29971618ecef3c002181/dc1d95c904a04a6a986b775e55f58bd9/chrome.jpg

**Excel formatting**: after opening the excel you will have to adjust columns widths and formatting. I normally align cells on top and wrap text to have a readable format - see the samples in xlsx.
